# Advanced-Programming 1 (Pathfinding Algorithms)

The following project implements some of pathfinding algorithms and utilizes numerous design patterns, it uses client-server model in order to receive multiple problems in parallel and solves them in parallel (using threads).

Pathfinding algorithms found in this project:

- DFS
- BFS (Breadth First Search)
- Best First Search
- A* (A-star)

## Project architecture:

In this project we're utilizing many ideas that we learned in class in order to have an efficient working and maintainable code, some of those ideas are:

- Solution caching:

    Given a new problem, solve it and save it in cache before returning, that way if the client asks for the same exact problem we simply look it up and return back the solution.

    Cache is mainly used in order to save computation time by utilizing memory to save existing solution where we can look it up in O(1) time complexity.

    The current implementation of cache utilizes hashing techniques in order to covnert a given problem to a number where we can use it as a key in order to lookup the solution for it, all solutions are saved as text files (for persistency).

- Pathfinding server:

    A server that can accept up to 10 clients in parallel, where clients connect to the server and sends their problem to solve.

    The server is implementing using low-level tcp sockets and uses threads for parallelism.

    Server default port is 5600, can be customized (instructions below).

- Algorithm implementation:

    Each algorithm implementation is utilizing a defined interface called ```<<Solver>>``` where it has a solve function.

    This allows us to easily use and swap algorithms during runtime where we can tell the program which algorithm we want or just run on all of them, this is called **dependency injection**, where one class knows only the interface and we can just pass it an instance of the implementation through constructor or a setter function, that way the client handler can just run it without worrying about custom configuration or the need to rewrite code and recompile.

## Compiling

Download or clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/ModiEsawi/AP-PROJ2.git
```

Then compile using

```
g++ -std=c++14 *.cpp -Wall -Wextra -Wshadow -Wnon-virtual-dtor -pedantic -o a.out -pthread
```

## Usage

Running the server:

```
./a.out PORT
```

Conencting to server and sending problems:

You can use any TCP client in order to connect to the server, such as python or normal c, the format that the server accepts is as follows;

```
NXM MATRIX (comma separated, where each cell has some cost value)
START POINT (x,y)
GOAL POINT (x,y)
end
```

## Statistics

In this project there are two PDF files that contains statistics graphs about each algorithm implementation, [one](https://github.com/ModiEsawi/AP-PROJ2/blob/master/pathCost.pdf) is about cost per problem size and the [other](https://github.com/ModiEsawi/AP-PROJ2/blob/master/EvaluatedNodes.pdf) about how many nodes it each algorithm evaluate per problem size.

We can see from the graphs that DFS will result in the most expensive paths each time while A* and BFS can result in similar routes with similar costs.

But in terms how many nodes it evaluates, DFS evaluates the least since it always picks the first node it can see and continue from there while BFS will evaluate more nodes because it tries to scans everything, A* uses heuristics and Best FS uses priority, which could result in more nodes getting evaluated for the price of better routes.
